###### MOTIVATION:
While we were previously working on projects based on CNN, we were trying to predict just a single characteristic or output variable. Like the age of a person or animal, gender of a person, etc. We then started to think about how to predict various output variables all at once when given an input. While researching this topic, we came across multi-model machine learning or deep learning techniques. Hence, this inquisitiveness motivated us to take up this project idea. We want to implement a multi-modal deep learning technique to detect a personâ€™s age, sex, and race/ethnicity when given an image input.
